## **Overview**

MingleMakers is a **digital ecosystem designed to empower artisans and suppliers** by solving the invisible bottleneck in the craft industry: **raw material procurement**. While traditional platforms focus on selling finished products, MingleMakers addresses the **supply-side challenge**, ensuring artisans have access to quality materials at affordable prices while fostering collaboration.

The platform introduces a **dual-track approach**:

1. **Artisan Track** – Connects artisans to suppliers, facilitates barter & swap, and provides access to eco-friendly raw materials.  
2. **Supplier Track** – Allows suppliers to reach artisans directly, expand visibility, and build a sustainable supply chain.

## **Key Features**

### **For Artisans**
- **Raw Material Discovery** – Find suppliers offering quality materials at competitive prices.  
- **Barter & Swap Community** – Join local artisan clusters to exchange or share materials within a trusted network.  
- **Sustainable Materials Access** – Easily source eco-friendly materials to support green production.  
- **Peer Networking** – Connect with artisans sharing similar values, craft techniques, and supply needs.  

### **For Suppliers**
- **Direct Artisan Connections** – Reach artisans actively seeking materials.  
- **Supplier Visibility Dashboard** – Showcase products and stock availability.  
- **Community Engagement** – Participate in artisan clusters and support sustainable practices.

### **Shared Platform Benefits**
- **Dual Track Approach** – Both artisans and suppliers benefit simultaneously.  
- **Sustainability Metrics Tracking** – Monitor % artisans sourcing eco-materials, waste reduction, and inclusion of women/rural artisans.  
- **Smart Community Clustering** – Artisans are grouped based on material requirements and shared interests to encourage collaboration.

## **Why MingleMakers Stands Out**

- **Supply-Side Focus:** Unlike typical marketplaces that only focus on selling finished goods, we empower artisans to **source materials efficiently**.  
- **Dual Track Ecosystem:** Both **artisans and suppliers** benefit from the platform simultaneously, creating a **self-sustaining digital community**.  
- **Community & Collaboration:** The barter and swap system promotes **peer-to-peer sharing**, reducing waste and cost.  
- **Sustainability-Driven:** Eco-material sourcing and inclusion of rural and women artisans ensures social and environmental impact.  
- **Hackathon-Ready MVP:** Fully functional prototype hosted on Firebase, showcasing 2–3 working features:  
  - Raw material discovery  
  - Artisan barter & swap community  
  - Supplier visibility & engagement
